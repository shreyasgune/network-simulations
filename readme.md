# Network Simulations
This is my attempt to test stuff that I've read in the books. This was by far the best most clear realization of how networking works.

## Motivation
I just wanted to find out how networks work. This series takes care of most of the basic concepts.

## Installation
You're going to need Cisco Packet Tracer to try these things out. There might be a student edition you can get hold of.
[Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/about-networking-academy/packet-tracer/) 
For more advanced labs, I'm using GNS3. There is a ton of configuration that is required to be taken care of and I will expand on those
specifics in this section on 5/21/2016. Keep looking into this space for the updated info. 
If you wan't to play around, go ahead and download [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/software/download).
