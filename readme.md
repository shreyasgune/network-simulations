# Network Simulations
This is my attempt to test stuff that I've read in the books. This was by far the best most clear realization of how networking works.

## Motivation
I just wanted to find out how networks work. This series takes care of most of the basic concepts.

## Installation
You're going to need Cisco Packet Tracer to try these things out. There might be a student edition you can get hold of.
